:::tip Yêu cầu
Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of `1` bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
:::

Note:
- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.

**Example 1:**
- Input: `n = 00000000000000000000000000001011`
- Output: 3
- Explanation: The input binary string `00000000000000000000000000001011` has a total of three '1' bits.

**Example 2:**
- Input: `n = 00000000000000000000000010000000`
- Output: 1
- Explanation: The input binary string `00000000000000000000000010000000` has a total of one '1' bit.

**Example 3:**
- Input: `n = 11111111111111111111111111111101`
- Output: 31
- Explanation: The input binary string `11111111111111111111111111111101` has a total of thirty one '1' bits.

**Constraints:**
- The input must be a binary string of length 32.
 
**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
